Basic Residue - Machine Learning Models for Regression Analysis

Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to analyze and predict values from various datasets under the Basic Residue project. The primary objective is to evaluate linear regression models trained on datasets with varying scatter and deviation, and to compare their performance using key metrics.

Datasets

dataset_high_scatter
dataset_low_scatter
dataset_negative_deviation
dataset_positive_deviation
Key Steps

Data Preprocessing: Load datasets, check for missing values, and review data structure.
Model Training: Train linear regression models to predict the relationship between the target variable ("Predicted") and the feature ("Actual").
Model Evaluation: Evaluate performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²).
Visualization: Plot Predicted vs Actual values and residuals (Predicted - Actual) to visually assess model performance.
Technologies & Tools

Python
scikit-learn
Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
